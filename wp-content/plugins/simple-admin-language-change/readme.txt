Simple and lightweight solution for changing the language of the admin area. Front site locale and language remain unchanged.

== Description ==

Have you ever struggled with setting up a theme or plugin because of bad localisation? Not corresponding to the manual or documentation? Googling for How to's but your web has different locale and you don't want to switch between them?

This simple and lightweight plugin allows you to set locale for admin area only (except General Options page) and keep it separate from your page locale. Simple and easy. Automatically set to English, but you can change it in the General Options page settings.

Applies only to administrator accounts.

== Installation ==
= EN =
1. Upload the plugin to your website or install via plugin management.
1. Check whether the WooCommerce plugin is installed and active.
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress administration
1. (If you wish, go to the  `Settings` and  `General` to select different installed language instead of English)
1. Done!

== Screenshots ==

1. Settings of Admin language in General Settings.
